# Knowledge Assist: A Smart Information Retrieval System with Gemma, MongoDB, and Advanced NLP

## Project Overview

The "Knowledge Assist" project focuses on developing an intelligent system for efficiently retrieving and generating informative responses to user queries. Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, MongoDB for data storage, and Gemma for response generation, the system enhances the overall search experience by providing accurate and relevant information to users.

## **Objective**:
   - The primary goal is to build a knowledge assistance system that combines retrieval-based and generative-based techniques.
   - It aims to provide users with accurate and relevant information in response to their queries, enhancing their overall search experience.

## Architecture

### Components:

1. **Gemma**: Gemma is a library used for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. It plays a key role in generating responses to user queries based on retrieved information.
   
2. **MongoDB**: MongoDB serves as both an operational and vector database. It efficiently stores, queries, and retrieves vector embeddings generated from textual data.

3. **Open Source Models**: The project utilizes open-source models for text embedding and vector search, such as SentenceTransformer for generating embeddings and MongoDB's vector search capabilities.

### Workflow:

1. **Data Preparation**: The project starts with preparing the dataset, which typically contains textual information such as movie plots.

2. **Embedding Generation**: Textual data from the dataset is converted into numerical embeddings using the SentenceTransformer library. These embeddings capture semantic information and are stored in MongoDB for efficient retrieval.

3. **Database Setup**: MongoDB is configured to serve as the database for storing both operational data and vector embeddings. A vector search index is created to enable fast and accurate similarity searches.

4. **User Query Processing**: When a user submits a query, the system generates an embedding for the query using the same embedding model. This embedding serves as the basis for vector search.

5. **Vector Search**: The system performs a vector search on the MongoDB collection using the query embedding. The search returns the most relevant documents based on semantic similarity, along with their respective scores.

6. **Response Generation**: Gemma is employed to generate responses based on the retrieved information. It combines the search results to produce coherent and informative responses to the user query.

## Workflow Example

1. **User Query**: A user submits a query, such as "What is the best romantic movie to watch and why?"

2. **Vector Search**: The system generates an embedding for the query and performs a vector search on the MongoDB collection. It retrieves documents that closely match the semantic content of the query.

3. **Response Generation**: Gemma processes the search results and generates a response that provides recommendations for the best romantic movies to watch, along with explanations or reviews.

## Benefits

- **Efficient Information Retrieval**: Leveraging vector embeddings and MongoDB's vector search capabilities enables efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant information.
  
- **Natural Language Generation**: Gemma enhances user experience by generating human-like responses to user queries, incorporating information from the retrieved documents.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: The use of MongoDB as a database provides scalability and flexibility, allowing the system to handle large volumes of data and adapt to changing requirements.

- **Integration with Open-Source Technologies**: By utilizing open-source models and libraries, the project benefits from community-driven development and continuous improvement in natural language processing and database technologies.

## Conclusion

The "Knowledge Assist" project offers a powerful solution for information retrieval and generation tasks. Its architecture, workflow, and integration with cutting-edge technologies make it a valuable tool for various applications, including recommendation systems, question answering, and conversational agents.
